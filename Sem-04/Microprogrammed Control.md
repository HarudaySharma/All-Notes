- The *function* of the controlled unit in a digital computer is to ==initiate sequence== of micro operations.
- The number of different type of micro instructions that are available in a given system is ==FINITE==.
- The complexity of the digital system is derived from the number of the sequences of micro operations that are performed.
- When the control signals are generated by hardware using conventional logic design techniques.
	The control unit is said to be **hard wire**.
- Microprogramming is a *second alternative* for designing the control unit of a digital computer.
- A computer that employs a microprogrammed control unit will have
	<u>Two seperate memories</u>:
	1. Main memory
		- The main memory is available to the users for storing programs
		- The contents of the main memory may alter when the data is manipulated and every time that program is changed.
		- The user program in main memory consists of **machine instructions** and **data**.
	2. Control memory
		- The control memory holds a **fixed microprogram**
			- That cannot be altered by the user.
		- The [[Microprogram]] *consists* of ==micro instructions t==hat
			- *Specifies* various internal control signal for execution of register micro operations.
		- Each machine instruction *initiates* a ==series of micro instructions in control memory.==
		- These micro instructions generate the micro operations to fetch the instruction from
			- Main memory, 
			- To evaluate the effective address,
			- To execute the operations specified by the instruction, and
			- To return control to the fetch phase in order to repeat the cycle for next instruction.
