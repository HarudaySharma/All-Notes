- There are variety of ways that parallel processing can be classified.
- It can be considered from, the internal organization of the processors, from the interconnection structure b/w processors or from the flow of information through the system. 
- One classification introduced by *MJ Flynn* considers the organization of a computer system by the number of instructions and data items that are manipulated simultaneously.
- The normal operation of a computer is to fetch instructions from memory, and execute them in the processor.
- The sequence of instructions read from memory constitutes the **instruction stream**.
- The operations performed on the data in the processor constitutes a **data stream**.
- Parallel processing may occur in the instruction stream, in the data stream or in both.

 *So flynn's classification divide the computers into **4** major groups*
 
 ### Classification of computers
#### 1. [[Single instruction stream single data stream (SISD)]]
#### 2. [[Single instruction stream multiple data stream (SIMD)]]
#### 3. [[Multiple instruction stream single data stream  (MISD)]]
#### 4. [[Multiple instruction stream multiple data stream (MIMD)]]
