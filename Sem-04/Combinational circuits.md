Is a circuit which will provide an output to any input at any instance of time.
- Used where we are not concerned with the system status.
- The output variables at any instance of time are dependent only on the present input variables.
- Memory unit is required. 
- Faster, because the delay b/w output and input is due to the propogation delay of gates only.
- Easy to design
