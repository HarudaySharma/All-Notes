When input is given, these circuits check the previous status of the system.
- Output is dependent not only on the present input but on prev. Inputs also.
- Output varibales at any instance of time are dependent not only on the present input but also on the present state of system, i.e 
- [[Memory unit]] is required.
- Slower.
- comparatively harder to design.
