- A computer instruction is a binary code that specifies sequence of micro operations for the computer.
-  [[Instruction codes]] together with data are stored in memory.
- The computer reads each instruction from memory and places it in the **control register**
- The control then interprets the binary code of the instruction and procceds to execute it by using a sequence of micro operations.
- Every processor has its *unique instruction set*
