1. Implied mode => operand is in the Accumulator.
2. Immediate mode => the operand part of the instruction code is the data itself.
3. Register mode => the operand part contains the register number of the register in whose data is to be operated.
4. Register indirect mode => the operand part contains the register number of the register in which the effective address of the data is stored.
5. Autoincrement or autodecrement mode => register content is incremented or decremented.
6. Direct address mode => the operand contains the effective address of the data.
7. Indirect address mode => the operand part contains the address of a memory location which contains the effective address of the data.
8. Relative address mode => offset is provides which is to be used with the program counter to get the address of the data.
