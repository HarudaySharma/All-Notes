*Following is the approach I took for building this app* :-
- When someone visits the website, they will be redirected to the home page. 
	- Home page will have a question board containing all the questions yet to be resolved.
	- Home page will also contain all the necessary links for the website.
- User without log in will have read-only access to the questions.
- User can create a new account when visiting the sign up page.
	- After signing up, user will be redirected to the sign in page and there they can log in to the website.
- User logged in can write new questions and responses for the existing ones.
- User on visiting their profile - 
	- Can change there username, password and profile picture.
	- User can delete or sign out. 
	- User can also see all the questions asked by them.
