- Process-to-process delivery needs two identifiers,
	- IP address and 
	- Port number,
		- At each end to make a connection.
- The combination of an IP address and a port number is called a **socket address**.
- The client socket address defines the client process uniquely
- The server socket address defines the server process uniquely.

- A transport layer protocol needs a pair of socket addresses:
	- The client socket address and 
	- The server socket address.
		- To make a connection.
