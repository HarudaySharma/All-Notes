*Method-03 :-*
- In this method, try finding a view equivalent serial schedule.
- By using the above three conditions,
	- write all the dependencies.
- Then, draw a graph using those dependencies.
- *If* there **exists <u>no</u> cycle** in the graph,
	- then the *schedule* **<u>is</u> view serializable** otherwise not.
