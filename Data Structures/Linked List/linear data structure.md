- A data structure is considered linear based on the way it organizes and store its elements.

###### Key Characteristics that define a data structure as linear :

1. Ordered Sequence :
	- A linear data structure maintains elements in a specific sequence or order.
	- Elements are arranged one after another.
2. Single access point :
	- There is typically a single access point to reach any element.
			Moving from one to the next.
3. Traversal :
	- You can traverse a linear data structure from one end and move in a specific direction until you find the element, or reach the end of the structure.

***Some points to to remember :***

- In some linear data structures like arrays, elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- But in structures like linked list the elements are might be stored non-contiguously, but they are still accessed in a linear, sequential manner using pointers or references.
