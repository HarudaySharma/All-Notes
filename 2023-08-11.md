## Computer Networks : 

Criteria on which a network depends are :

**transit time :**  
**Response Time :** elapsed time b/w inquiry and response
**Reliability :**
**Security :**


#### Types of connection
1. Point - to - point : Only two devices share a link
2. Multipoint : 

### Topologies

*Physical Topology* : The way in which network is lay down physically.

1. **Mesh topology :**  Here each device is connected to rest of the devices.
				*e.g.*  If there are `n` devices then each device is connected to `n-1` devices.
	- Each device has point to point connection to other devices.
	- total no. of links = `n * (n - 1) / 2`
	 ***Advantages:***
	 - there is no traffic in data comm. due to `pt` to `pt` links.
	 - Robust in nature *high accuracy*.
	 - privacy and security
	 - fault identification and isolation is very easy 
 
2. **Star topology :**  each device has a dedicated point-to-point link only to a central controller ***called hub***;
	- Devices are not directly linked to one another.
	- It doesn't allow direct traffic b/w devices.
	- Controller act as an [[exchange]]
	***Advantages:***
	- less expensive than a mesh topology.
	- easy to install and reconfigure.
	***Disadvantages:***
	- 
3. **Ring topology :**
