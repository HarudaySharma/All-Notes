DBMS Important questions :

- ER diagram
- Data model


### Schemas :

- Schema is a overall description of the database.
- It defines the basic structure of how the data will be stored in the database.

- *example :* 
	- Type CUSTOMER = record 
	- CUSTOMER_ID:INTEGER
	- CUSTOMER_NAME: String
	- CUSTOMER_ADD: String

##### Sub Schema
- Sub schema always store the information that is required by the user only.

##### Instance :
The collection of the data stored in the database at the particular moment is called the instance of a database.

##### Schema Architecture :

Abstraction is achieved by the help of 3-levels.

1. Internal (Physical) level
2. Conceptual (logical) level
3. External (view) level

#### Data Independence :

It is defined as the property of the `dbms` that helps you to change the database schema at one level of a database system without requiring you to change the schema at the next higher level.

Or 

- Data independence means users and data should not directly interact with each other.
- The user should be at different level and data should be present at some other level.
- By doing so, Data Independence can be achieved.

###### Types :
1. Logical data independence :
	- Define able to change the conceptual schema without having to change the external schema.
	- Used to separate the external level from the conceptual view.
	- **Why it is important**?
2. Physical data independence :
	- Defined as the capacity to change the internal schema without having to change the conceptual schema.
